These Matlab codes can be used to generate the figures from 
Blurring the Busse balloon: Patterns in a Stochastic Klausmeier mode
Authors: Hamster, Van Heijster and Siero.

The files Deterministic and SingleStochastic contain the files to generate a single deterministic or stochastic simulations, such as in Figures 2, 5 and A3.
Deterministic periodic stationary states are used as initial conditions and stored in the file PeriodicSolutions. 

The file plotm0 contains the numerical data for the boundary of the Busse Balloon, computed by Siero using Auto. 

The file EscapeTime contains the script to generate figure 7 and related figures.

The file StationaryDist contians the script to generate figure 10.
